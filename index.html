              <p>‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
              been looking to make a
              <br/>transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
              experience here. I signed up for <br />the free intro course and
              found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
              12 <br />weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
              Since completing the course, I've <br />successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.‚Äù</p>

              ‚ÄúBefore joining the bootcamp, I've
              <br/>never written a line of code. I needed <br/>some structure
              from professionals <br/>who can help me learn programming
              <br/>step by step. I was encouraged to <br/>enroll by a former
              student of theirs <br/>who can only say wonderful things
              <br/>about the program. The entire <br/>curriculum and staff did
              not <br/>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br/>and I never
              had to wait long for <br/>assistance. The agile team project, in
              <br/>particular, was outstanding. It took <br/>my learning to
              the next level in a way <br/>that no tutorial could ever have. In
              <br/>fact, I've often referred to it during <br/>interviews as
              an example of my <br/>developent experience. It certainly
              <br/>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br/>developer after
              receiving multiple <br/>offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
