            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned 
            <br>were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I

            ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been
            looking to make a 
            <br>transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for 
            <br>the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've 
            <br>successfully switched careers, working as
            a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp

          ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find

          Such a life-changing

        <div class="paragraphkira">
          ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I've 
          <br>never written a line of code. I needed 
          <br>some structure from professionals 
          <br>who can help me learn programming 
          <br>step by step. I was encouraged to 
          <br>enroll by a former student of theirs 
          <br>who can only say wonderful things 
          <br>about the program. The entire 
          <br>curriculum and staff did not 
          <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on 
          <br>and I never had to wait long for 
          <br>assistance. The agile team project, in 
          <br>particular, was outstanding. It took 
          <br>my learning to the next level in a way 
          <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In 
          <br>fact, I've often referred to it during 
          <br>interviews as an example of my 
          <br>developent experience. It certainly 
          <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack
          <br>developer after receiving multiple 
          <br>offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
